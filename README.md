AI Basketball Coach Assistant


Project Overview
This project is an AI-powered basketball coach assistant, developed as part of our group project during the Headstarter Fellowship program. As a team of basketball enthusiasts, we wanted to create a tool that could assist players and coaches in improving their skills, developing strategies, and achieving their full potential on the court.

The AI Basketball Coach Assistant is designed to provide users with expert advice on various aspects of basketball, including drills, techniques, and game strategies. The assistant is multilingual, capable of responding in different languages based on the user's preference, and it is specifically trained to focus only on basketball-related questions.

Features
Expert Coaching: Offers tailored advice for players and coaches at different skill levels.
Multilingual Support: Responds to queries in multiple languages based on user requests.
Basketball-Focused: Strictly responds to basketball-related inquiries, ensuring a focused coaching experience.
Scenario Analysis: Provides insights on specific plays and historical examples to enhance understanding.
Motivation
Our love for basketball and our passion for technology drove us to create this assistant. We believe that this tool can be an invaluable resource for anyone looking to improve their basketball skills, whether they are beginners or seasoned players.

Usage
To interact with the AI Basketball Coach Assistant, simply ask basketball-related questions, and the assistant will provide relevant and practical advice. If a non-basketball-related question is asked, the assistant will politely redirect the user back to basketball topics.
